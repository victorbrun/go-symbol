`gosymbol` is a Go package for performing symbolic computations. Its main purpouse is to be educational and to give me a chance to dive into the inner workings of symbolic computations and computer algebra systems. The development journey will be published as a series of [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@victor.w.brun).
